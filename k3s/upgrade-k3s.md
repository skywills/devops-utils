## Using System Upgrade Controller to upgrade, can refer to https://docs.k3s.io/upgrades/automated

## Example

1- To use the image with the system-upgrade-controller, you have first to run the controller either directly or deploy it on the k3s cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller/master/manifests/system-upgrade-controller.yaml
```

You should see the upgrade controller starting in `system-upgrade` namespace.

2- Label the nodes you want to upgrade with the right label:
```
kubectl label node <node-name> k3s-upgrade=true
```

3- Run the upgrade plan in the k3s cluster

```
---
apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: k3s-latest
  namespace: system-upgrade
spec:
  concurrency: 1
  version: v1.17.2-k3s1
  nodeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: k3s-upgrade, operator: Exists}
  serviceAccountName: system-upgrade
  drain:
    force: true
  upgrade:
    image: rancher/k3s-upgrade
``` 

The upgrade controller should watch for this plan and execute the upgrade on the labeled nodes. For more information about system-upgrade-controller and plan options please visit [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) official repo.
